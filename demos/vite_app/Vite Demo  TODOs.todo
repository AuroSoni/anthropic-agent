Main Issues to Address:
    ✔ Truly Inline the Citations @done(26-01-01 19:22)
    The approach would probably be to merge the citations and text blocks into a 
    single block at parsing time, then render that block as a sigle text block with 
    custom markdown support for citations.
    This may need to be done to extend embedded tags like <chart> and <table> also.
        ✘ Regenerate the parser integration test. @cancelled(26-01-01 19:22)
        ✘ Regenerate the necessary unit tests. @cancelled(26-01-01 19:22)

Future Improvements:
    ☐ Allow PDF/Image/Container uploads.
    ✔ Allow complex content block prompts. @done(26-01-01 19:35)
    ☐ Allow custom rendering of embedded tags like <chart> and <table>.
    ☐ Allow Creation of Threads.
    ☐ Explore general UI improvements.
