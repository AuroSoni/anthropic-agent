Main TODOS:
    ☐ Truly Inline the Citations
    The approach would probably be to merge the citations and text blocks into a 
    single block at parsing time, then render that block as a sigle text block with 
    custom markdown support for citations.
    This may need to be done to extend embedded tags like <chart> and <table> also.
        ☐ Regenerate the parser integration test.
        ☐ Regenerate the necessary unit tests.
