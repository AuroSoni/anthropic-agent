"""Agent configuration, conversation, and supporting dataclasses.

AgentConfig is the persistent agent session state, resumable across runs.
Conversation is a single run record for UI display and pagination.
LLMConfig is the base for provider-specific LLM configuration.
PendingToolRelay captures state when the agent pauses for frontend/user tool responses.

Serialization note: These dataclasses do NOT have to_dict()/from_dict() methods.
Storage adapters are responsible for serialization/deserialization externally.

    reference it without knowing provider details.

    Provider subclasses (e.g., ``AnthropicLLMConfig``) extend this with
    their specific fields. The ``provider`` field on ``AgentConfig``
    tells storage adapters which subclass to reconstruct on load.
